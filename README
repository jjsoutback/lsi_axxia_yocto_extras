==========

This is the official OpenEmbedded/Yocto BSP layer for LSI’s family of
Axxia Communication Processors.

Supported MACHINES:

	elpaso - ppc476
	axm5500sim - ARM Cortex A15 simulator

The El Paso machine is LSI’s ACP344x reference platform. The ACP344x
processor contains an embedded PPC476 CPU subsystem which is the focus
of this BSP. The PPC476 CPU subsystem includes: up to 4 PPC476 SMP cores,
UART, SSP, FEMAC, NAND, USB, I2C, GPIO, PCIe and SRIO controllers.

The axm5500sim machine is LSI’s Axxia Software Environment (ASE) simulation
platform for the AXM55xx family of devices. The AXM55xx contains an embedded
ARM Cortex-A15 CPU subsystem which is the focus of this BSP. The ARM Cortex-A15
CPU subsystem contains up to 16 Cortex-A15 cores, UART, SSP, FEMAC, SD/MMC,
USB, I2C, GPIO, PCIe and SRIO controllers.
